# RTS2-Python

A Python implementation of the RTS2 (Remote Telescope System 2nd Version) device drivers framework. This project provides a complete Python-based alternative to the C++ RTS2 components, focusing on ease of development and extensibility while maintaining full protocol compatibility with the original system.

## Overview

RTS2 (Remote Telescope System 2nd Version) is an open-source observatory control system designed for robotic observatories. This Python implementation provides:

- Complete RTS2 device driver (daemon) network protocol support
- Unified configuration system with command line, config files, and environment variables
- Device abstraction framework with mixin architecture for multi-function devices
- Type-safe value system with automatic network distribution
- Command handling with automatic registration and dispatch
- Device-to-device communication with automatic connection management
- Production-ready implementations for filter wheels, focusers, and GRB detection

The framework is designed to work seamlessly within existing RTS2 installations, connecting to centrald and communicating with other RTS2 components.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rts2-python.git
cd rts2-python

# Install dependencies
pip install pyserial psycopg2-binary gcn-kafka
```

## Quick Start

Run the example dummy filter wheel to test the system:

```bash
python filterd_dummy.py -d W0 -p 0 --filters "J:H:K:R:G:B"
```

## Architecture

The system is built around several core components:

- **App**: Application framework handling configuration, command line parsing, and device lifecycle
- **Device**: Base device class with integrated network communication and configuration
- **DeviceConfig**: Unified configuration system supporting multiple sources with proper precedence
- **NetworkManager**: Handles all network communication, authentication, and automatic device discovery
- **Value**: Type-safe values with change tracking, callbacks, and automatic distribution
- **Mixins**: Reusable device functionality components for filters, focusers, and other instruments

## Supported Devices

### Filter Wheels
- **FilterMixin**: Complete filter wheel functionality as a mixin class
- **Filterd**: Standalone filter wheel base class
- **DummyFilter**: Simulated filter wheel for testing
- **OvisMultiFunction**: Real hardware driver for OVIS spectrograph (combines filter + focuser)

### Focusers
- **FocuserMixin**: Complete focuser functionality with temperature compensation
- **Focusd**: Standalone focuser base class with position control and limits
- **DummyFocuser**: Simulated focuser with gradual movement simulation

### Observatory Control
- **GrbDaemon**: Production GRB detection daemon with modern GCN Kafka interface
- **TemperatureSensor**: Example environmental monitoring device
- **WatcherDevice**: Device monitoring and inter-device communication example

### Multi-Function Devices
The mixin architecture allows combining multiple instrument types in a single device:

```python
class MultiInstrument(Device, FilterMixin, FocuserMixin):
    def setup_config(self, config):
        self.setup_filter_config(config)
        self.setup_focuser_config(config)

    def apply_config(self, config):
        super().apply_config(config)
        self.apply_filter_config(config)
        self.apply_focuser_config(config)
```

## Configuration System

The unified configuration system supports multiple sources with proper precedence:

1. Built-in defaults
2. System config files (`/etc/rts2/rts2.conf`)
3. User config files (`~/.rts2/rts2.conf`)
4. Explicit config files (`--config myconfig.conf`)
5. Environment variables (`RTS2_DEVICE_VARIABLE`)
6. Command line arguments (highest priority)

Example device with custom configuration:

```python
class MyDevice(Device, DeviceConfig):
    def setup_config(self, config):
        config.add_argument('--my-option', help='Custom option')
        config.add_argument('--my-port', type=int, default=8080,
                           section='hardware', help='Hardware port')

    def apply_config(self, config):
        super().apply_config(config)
        self.my_option = config.get('my_option')
        self.my_port = config.get('my_port')
```

## Device-to-Device Communication

Devices can automatically establish connections and monitor other devices:

```python
# Monitor another device's values
self.network.register_interest_in_value(
    device_name="TEMP",
    value_name="temperature",
    callback=self._on_temperature_update
)

# Monitor device state changes
self.network.register_state_interest(
    device_name="CCD1",
    state_callback=self._on_ccd_state_changed
)
```

Connections are established automatically when centrald provides device information, with automatic reconnection on failure.

## GRB Detection System

The included GRB daemon provides production-ready gamma-ray burst detection:

- Modern GCN Kafka interface replacing legacy socket protocols
- Robust VOEvent XML parsing with mission-specific handlers
- PostgreSQL database integration with RTS2 target system
- Automatic observation triggering with configurable constraints
- Comprehensive monitoring and statistics

```bash
python grbd.py --gcn-client-id YOUR_ID --gcn-client-secret YOUR_SECRET
```

## Creating Device Drivers

Extend the appropriate base class or use mixins:

```python
from filterd import Filterd

class MyFilterWheel(Filterd):
    def setup_config(self, config):
        super().setup_config(config)
        config.add_argument('--serial-port', help='Serial port device')

    def set_filter_num(self, new_filter):
        # Implement hardware-specific movement
        return 0  # Success

    def get_filter_num(self):
        # Read current position from hardware
        return self.current_position

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = App(description='My Filter Wheel Driver')
    app.register_device_options(MyFilterWheel)
    args = app.parse_args()
    device = app.create_device(MyFilterWheel)
    app.run()
```

## Key Features

- **Full RTS2 Compatibility**: Seamless integration with existing RTS2 installations
- **Modern Python Architecture**: Type hints, dataclasses, and proper error handling
- **Unified Configuration**: Single system handling all configuration sources
- **Mixin Architecture**: Reusable components for multi-function devices
- **Automatic Device Discovery**: Zero-configuration device-to-device communication
- **Production Ready**: Used in real observatory environments

## Logging

The system uses RTS2-compatible logging with proper formatting:

```
2024-05-04T12:34:56.789 UTC DEVICENAME I Log message here
```

All network communication and device interactions are logged for debugging and monitoring.
